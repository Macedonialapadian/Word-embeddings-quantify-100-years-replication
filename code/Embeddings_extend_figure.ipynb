In rebuke, he placed two fingers under his nose to simulate a Hitler mustache and thrust his arm in a Nazi salute.\\n\\nMarc Zoro, right, an Ivory Coast native, was a target of racial slurs from the home fans in Messina, Italy. Adriano, a star with Inter Milan, tried to persuade him to stay on the field.\\n\\nFrom now until its conclusion on July 9, Jeff Z. Klein and other staff members of The Times and International Herald Tribune will track the world's most popular sporting event.\\n\\nYour guide to the games in Germany: teams, rosters, schedules, statistics, venues and more.\\n\\nIn April, the American defender Oguchi Onyewu, playing for his professional club team in Belgium, dismissively gestured toward fans who were making simian chants at him. Then, as he went to throw the ball inbounds, Onyewu said a fan of the opposing team reached over a barrier and punched him in the face.\\n\\nInternational soccer has been plagued for years by violence among fans, including racial incidents. But FIFA, soccer's Zurich-based world governing body, said there has been a recent surge in discriminatory behavior toward blacks by fans and other players, an escalation that has dovetailed with the signing of more players from Africa and Latin America by elite European clubs.\\n\\nThis \\\"deplorable trend,\\\" as FIFA has called it, now threatens to embarrass the sport on its grandest stage, the World Cup, which opens June 9 for a monthlong run in 12 cities around Germany. More than 30 billion cumulative television viewers are expected to watch part of the competition and Joseph S. Blatter, FIFA's president, has vowed to crack down on racist behavior during the tournament.\\n\\nUnderlining FIFA's concerns, the issue has been included on the agenda at its biannual Congress, scheduled to be held this week in Munich. A campaign against bigotry includes \\\"Say No to Racism\\\" stadium banners, television commercials, and team captains making pregame speeches during the quarterfinals of the 32-team tournament.\\n\\nPlayers, coaches and officials have been threatened with sanctions. But FIFA has said it would not be practical to use the harshest penalties available to punish misbehaving fans \\u0097 halting matches, holding games in empty stadiums and deducting points that teams receive for victories and ties.\\n\\nPlayers and antiracism experts said they expected offensive behavior during the tournament, including monkey-like chanting; derisive singing; the hanging of banners that reflect neofascist and racist beliefs; and perhaps the tossing of bananas or banana peels, all familiar occurrences during matches in Spain, Italy, eastern Germany and eastern Europe.\\n\\n\\\"For us it's quite clear this is a reflection of underlying tensions that exist in European societies,\\\" said Piara Powar, director of the London-based antiracist soccer organization Kick It Out. He said of Eastern Europe: \\\"Poverty, unemployment, is a problem. Indigenous people are looking for easy answers to blame. Often newcomers bear the brunt of the blame.\\\"\\n\\nYet experts and players also said they believed the racist behavior would be more constrained at the World Cup than it was during play in various domestic leagues around Europe, because of increased security, the international makeup of the crowds, higher ticket prices and a sense that spectators would be generally well behaved on soccer's grandest stage.\\n\\n\\\"We have to differentiate inside and outside the stadium,\\\" said Kurt Wachter, project coordinator for the Vienna-based Football Against Racism in Europe, a network of organizations that seeks to fight bigotry and xenophobia in 35 countries.\\n\\n\\\"Racism is a feature of many football leagues inside and outside Europe,\\\" said Wachter, who expects most problems to occur outside stadiums where crowds are less controlled. \\\"We're sure we will see some things we're used to seeing. It won't stop because of the World Cup.\\\"\\n\\nParticularly worrisome are the possibilities of attacks by extremist groups on spectators and visitors in train stations, bars, restaurants and open areas near the stadiums, Wachter and other experts said. To promote tolerance, he said his organization would organize street soccer matches outside World Cup stadiums.\\n\\nRecent attacks in the eastern Germany city of Potsdam on an Ethiopian-born engineer and in eastern Berlin on a state lawmaker of Turkish descent, along with a government report showing an increase in right-wing violence, have ignited fears that even sporadic hate crimes and other intolerant behavior could mar the World Cup, whose embracing motto is A Time to Make Friends.\\n\\nFar-right extremism is isolated on the fringe of German society, and the German government has intended to confront its Nazi past while preaching openness and tolerance. Germany has one of the world's lowest rates of violent crime. Still, an immigrant group called the Africa Council said it would publish a \\\"No Go\\\" guide for nonwhites during the World Cup, particularly for some areas of eastern Berlin and for surrounding towns of the state of Brandenburg.\\n\\nIn mid-May, a former government spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, caused a furor when he tried to assist visitors by advising that anyone \\\"with a different skin color\\\" avoid visiting small and midsize towns in Brandenburg and elsewhere in eastern Germany, or they \\\"may not leave with their lives.\\\"\\n\\nThese remarks received blunt criticism from high-ranking German officials. Wolfgang Sch\\u00e4uble, the minister of the interior, said there were no areas in which World Cup visitors should feel threatened, calling Germany \\\"one of the safest places in the world.\\\"\\n\\nAngela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, has warned that \\\"anybody who threatens, attacks or, worse, kills anybody because of the color of his skin or because he comes from another country will face the full force of the law.\\\"\\n\\nThe Bundesliga in Germany is one of the world's top professional soccer leagues, and has not experienced widespread racism. Incidents involving racial abuse of black players are more prevalent in semiprofessional and amateur leagues in eastern Germany. One of the cities playing host to the World Cup, Leipzig, is in the former East Germany. Another, Berlin, was partly in East Germany.\\n\\nAfter making a Nazi salute, which is illegal in Germany, Ogungbure of Nigeria was investigated by the authorities. But a charge of unconstitutional behavior against him was soon dropped because his gesture had been meant to renounce extremist activity.\\n\\n\\\"I regret what I did,\\\" Ogungbure said in a telephone interview from Leipzig. \\\"I should have walked away. I'm a professional, but I'm a human, too. They don't spit on dogs. Why should they spit on me? I felt like a nobody.\\\"\\n\\nGerald Asamoah, a forward on Germany's World Cup team and a native of Ghana, has been recounting an incident in the 1990's when he was pelted with bananas before a club match in Cottbus. \\\"I'll never forget that,\\\" he said in a television interview. \\\"It's like we're not people.\\\" He has expressed anger and sadness over a banner distributed by a right-wing group that admonished, \\\"No Gerald, You Are Not Germany.\\\"\\n\\nCory Gibbs, an American defender who formerly played professionally in Germany, said there were restaurants and nightclubs in eastern Germany \\u0097 and even around Hamburg in the west \\u0097 where he was told \\\"You're not welcome\\\" because he was black.\\n\\n\\\"I think racism is everywhere,\\\" said Gibbs, who will miss the World Cup because of a knee injury. \\\"But I feel in Germany racism is a lot more direct.\\\"\\n\\nRacist behavior at soccer matches is primarily displayed by men and is fueled by several factors, according to experts: alcohol; the perceived \\\"us versus them\\\" threat of multiculturalism in societies that were once more ethnically homogenous; the difficult economic transition of eastern European nations since the fall of the Berlin Wall; and crude attempts to unnerve opposing players during bitter, consuming rivalries.\\n\\nOther observers say that the soccer stadium in Europe has become a communal soapbox, one of the few remaining public spaces where spectators can be outrageous and where political correctness does not exist and is even discouraged.\\n\\n\\\"Nowhere else other than football do people meet someplace and have a stage for shouting things as an anonymous mass,\\\" said Gerd Dembowski, director of a Berlin-based antiracist organization called Floodlight. \\\"You can shout things you would never say in your normal life, let out your frustrations.\\\"\\n\\nNot all the misbehavior can be traced to fans or to Europe. Players and coaches have also been transgressors.\\n\\nLuis Aragon\\u00e9s, Spain's World Cup coach, was fined in 2004 after making racial remarks about the French star Thierry Henry. In March, in the Brazilian league, the defender Antonio Carlos was suspended for 120 days, and 4 additional matches, after an incident in which he shouted \\\"monkey\\\" at an opposing player who was black. But it was an incident in Spain on Feb. 25 that galvanized antiracist sentiment and prodded FIFA into taking a tougher stand against bigoted behavior. That match, in Zaragoza, was temporarily halted in the 77th minute by the referee, who threatened to cancel the remaining 13 minutes after Samuel Eto'o, the star forward for Barcelona, was subjected to a chorus of racial taunts. Eto'o threatened to leave the field. His coach and teammates eventually persuaded him to continue, and last month Barcelona won the European Champions Cup.\\n\\nEto'o has become one of the sport's most outspoken players on the subject of racism. \\\"I'll continue to play,\\\" Eto'o, whose national team, Cameroon, did not qualify for the World Cup, said this week through his agent. \\\"I'm not going to give up and hide and put my head down. I'll score goals against the teams whose fans are making rude noises.\\\"\\n\\nUnder pressure to curb what it acknowledged was an increase in racist incidents, FIFA in late March announced a stricter set of penalties that would apply for club and national team matches. The sanctions would include suspensions of five matches for players and officials who make discriminatory gestures, fines of $16,600 to $25,000 for each offense and two-year stadium bans for offending spectators. It also said teams, which receive 3 points in the standings for a victory, would have 3 points deducted on a first offense by misbehaving players, officials or fans.\\n\\nBlatter, the FIFA president, told reporters that the 3-point deduction for abhorrent fan behavior would apply during the World Cup, then backed away from his comments in April. Blatter declined to comment for this article. And it remains unclear exactly what penalties will be levied against World Cup teams for offensive behavior by fans, coaches and players.\\n\\nNicolas Maingot, a FIFA spokesman, said World Cup sanctions would be made public later. But in an e-mail response to questions, he said: \\\"Only racist abuses in the field of play will be punished. For fans, it will be impossible, due to the multinationality of the audience. In other words, it would be impossible to identify from which side would potential racist abusers come.\\\"\\n\\nCritics counter that spectators are supposed to have their names on their tickets, so identifying offending fans should be relatively easy.\\n\\nOnyewu, the American defender who was punched by an opposing fan in Belgium, said the man was identified through an anonymous tip and was barred from attending matches for two years. He said he did not retaliate because he believed that racist behavior reflected acts of a minority of fans.\\n\\n\\\"I'm anticipating a more professional environment in Germany because it's the World Cup,\\\" Onyewu said. Even so, he said, although antiracist efforts could restrict public behavior, \\\"that's only helping the exterior.\\\"\\n\\nHe added, \\\"The interior mind thinking, you can't really change that.\\\"\",\"summary\":\"A surge in discriminatory behavior toward blacks by fans and other players threatens to embarrass soccer.\",\"compression\":137.4705882353,\"coverage\":1.0,\"density\":7.8235294118,\"compression_bin\":\"high\",\"coverage_bin\":\"high\",\"density_bin\":\"mixed\"}\n",

It was collected by tapping directly into some of the American telecommunication system's main arteries, they said.\\n\\nAs part of the program approved by President Bush for domestic surveillance without warrants, the N.S.A. has gained the cooperation of American telecommunications companies to obtain backdoor access to streams of domestic and international communications, the officials said.\\n\\nThe government's collection and analysis of phone and Internet traffic have raised questions among some law enforcement and judicial officials familiar with the program. One issue of concern to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which has reviewed some separate warrant applications growing out of the N.S.A.'s surveillance program, is whether the court has legal authority over calls outside the United States that happen to pass through American-based telephonic \\\"switches,\\\" according to officials familiar with the matter.\\n\\n\\\"There was a lot of discussion about the switches\\\" in conversations with the court, a Justice Department official said, referring to the gateways through which much of the communications traffic flows. \\\"You're talking about access to such a vast amount of communications, and the question was, How do you minimize something that's on a switch that's carrying such large volumes of traffic? The court was very, very concerned about that.\\\"\\n\\nSince the disclosure last week of the N.S.A.'s domestic surveillance program, President Bush and his senior aides have stressed that his executive order allowing eavesdropping without warrants was limited to the monitoring of international phone and e-mail communications involving people with known links to Al Qaeda.\\n\\nWhat has not been publicly acknowledged is that N.S.A. technicians, besides actually eavesdropping on specific conversations, have combed through large volumes of phone and Internet traffic in search of patterns that might point to terrorism suspects. Some officials describe the program as a large data-mining operation.\\n\\nThe current and former government officials who discussed the program were granted anonymity because it remains classified.\\n\\nBush administration officials declined to comment on Friday on the technical aspects of the operation and the N.S.A.'s use of broad searches to look for clues on terrorists. Because the program is highly classified, many details of how the N.S.A. is conducting it remain unknown, and members of Congress who have pressed for a full Congressional inquiry say they are eager to learn more about the program's operational details, as well as its legality.\\n\\nOfficials in the government and the telecommunications industry who have knowledge of parts of the program say the N.S.A. has sought to analyze communications patterns to glean clues from details like who is calling whom, how long a phone call lasts and what time of day it is made, and the origins and destinations of phone calls and e-mail messages. Calls to and from Afghanistan, for instance, are known to have been of particular interest to the N.S.A. since the Sept. 11 attacks, the officials said.\\n\\nThis so-called \\\"pattern analysis\\\" on calls within the United States would, in many circumstances, require a court warrant if the government wanted to trace who calls whom.\\n\\nThe use of similar data-mining operations by the Bush administration in other contexts has raised strong objections, most notably in connection with the Total Information Awareness system, developed by the Pentagon for tracking terror suspects, and the Department of Homeland Security's Capps program for screening airline passengers. Both programs were ultimately scrapped after public outcries over possible threats to privacy and civil liberties.\",\"summary\":\"The volume of information harvested, without \\r\\ncourt warrants, is much larger than the White \\r\\nHouse has acknowledged.\",\"compression\":33.6363636364,\"coverage\":0.9090909091,\"density\":4.7272727273,\"compression_bin\":\"medium\",\"coverage_bin\":\"medium\",\"density_bin\":\"mixed\"}\n",

On the other are Pfizer shareholders, angry over the 46 percent decline in market value since Mr. McKinnell took the reins.\\n\\nSome shareholders are threatening to withhold votes for several Pfizer directors over Mr. McKinnell's pay. Pfizer, meanwhile, is fighting back in the proxy contest, working overtime to convince shareholders that its directors deserve support.\\n\\nAdding drama to this battle is the effect that withheld votes may have on Pfizer directors. Such acts of shareholder defiance are strictly symbolic; at most companies directors can win a seat if they receive one \\\"yes\\\" vote in an election. Last year, though, Pfizer changed its guidelines so that any director who received more \\\"withhold\\\" votes than \\\"for\\\" votes will have to resign. If the board rejects the resignation offer, it will publicly state why.\\n\\nLike many other companies, Pfizer has a mighty arsenal, backed by shrewd alliances and relationships with institutional shareholders. The Pfizer battle, governance experts say, illustrates an imbalance of power between company owners and managers that is prevalent today.\\n\\n\\\"The management has these unlimited resources to fight back, and the shareholders are pretty much powerless,\\\" said John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group. \\\"The thing has gotten so out of hand that words almost fail me. The shareholders should not tolerate it.\\\"\\n\\nInstitutional shareholders, who vote the stock on behalf of their individual investors, are supposed to act in the best interests of those who own the stock, and the institutions questioned said they were careful to avoid conflicts in proxy votes. But shaking up the status quo may not always be in their own interest.\\n\\nPfizer is known for its assiduous courting of institutional shareholders. One way is through Margaret M. Foran, Pfizer's corporate secretary and vice president for corporate governance, who is co-chairwoman of the board at the Council of Institutional Investors, an influential organization of pension funds. She is also on the board of the International Corporate Governance Network, an institutional investor organization in London. Ms. Foran, who said she is a student of governance issues, added that her involvement in these organizations helped her stay current on best practices at corporations.\\n\\nMANY of Pfizer's biggest institutional stockholders also earn considerable fees for providing money management services to the company. These institutions could fear damaging such relationships by voting against the company. Some members of Pfizer's board serve on boards of firms that are among its larger shareholders, raising questions about their allegiances.\\n\\nManagement says Mr. McKinnell is being paid for 35 years of service in an industry that has very long business cycles for attaining measures of success established by the board. It says Pfizer's board continues to strengthen the connection between pay and performance.\\n\\n\\\"We have a duty to the shareholders to articulate and communicate the position of the board and I think that is what the company is intending to do,\\\" said Stanley O. Ikenberry, president emeritus at the University of Illinois and a member of Pfizer's board and compensation committee. \\\"Hank McKinnell's compensation is down sharply for the current year, but looked at both in the context of one year and multiple years and in terms of pension, the board has reviewed those issues, discussed them extensively and supports the decisions that have been made.\\\"\\n\\nBy contrast, a grass-roots group of businesspeople \\u0097 Investors for Director Accountability \\u0097 sees a pervasive problem in his pay. \\\"Mushrooming management compensation, unconnected to performance, is an obvious area where directors have failed the people they legally represent,\\\" the organization said last month. \\\"Shareholders should withhold their votes for the four nominees of the Pfizer board of directors who are members of the board's compensation committee. This would be a first step on a long road to restore director accountability to owners.\\\"\",\"summary\":\"The battle between Pfizer Inc.'s investors and its board illustrates an imbalance of power between company owners and managers that is prevalent today.\",\"compression\":33.88,\"coverage\":1.0,\"density\":11.72,\"compression_bin\":\"medium\",\"coverage_bin\":\"high\",\"density_bin\":\"extractive\"}\n",

So, why the connection between George and the beauty queen? Well, according to sources, Hamilton recently made the very smooth transition from interviewing a guest to dating a guest. Shortly after Smith's cheery Feb. 6 appearance on the \\\"George & Alana Show,\\\" Hamilton took Smith out on a dinner date. Hey, better to date a guest like Shawntel Smith than, say, Ed Begley Jr.\\n\\nSources say Smith did her guest spot and they just really hit it off. Hamilton, a Hall-of-Fame dame chaser, not too long ago said: \\\"I'm at a point where dating is boring. I like quiet.\\\" Don't hurt us man, we idolize you.\\n\\nMarcus Schenkenberg sitting in a barber's chair is like Cindy Crawford calling dermatologists to have the mole removed. It might sound shallow to you, but in the business of beauty, Marcus' new close-cropped hairstyle is a pretty risky move. We, of course, now like him more than ever and immediately make him eligible for our \\\"Against-the-Grain Hall of Fame.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's gonna lose me gigs, but it's also gonna get me gigs,\\\" Marcus told us while partying at Brinton Brewster's Wednesday night affairs at 40 Below. \\\"I just totally surprised the agencies. I didn't care.\\\" In fact, while Schenkenberg was in Italy, his New York agent got a call from another agent in Italy gushing about sightings of a kid who looks \\\"exactly like Marcus' little brother.\\\" Spooky.\\n\\nEither way, it hasn't stopped Hollywood from calling. Schenkenberg has already met with Zalman King and Joel Schumacher on future projects and just agreed to \\\"play a bad guy\\\" in the upcoming \\\"Prince Valiant\\\" film.\\n\\nNow that \\\"Saturday Night Live\\\" is making great strides at standing on the edge of comedy once again, it makes sense that their musical guests might represent that same sort of edge. (See Coolio, last week's performer.) Why then are some suits at the show sweating the appearance of next week's musical guest, Tupac Shakur?\\n\\n\\\"Maybe because he's probably gonna roll up with a posse of 40 guys,\\\" said a source close to the show. \\\"And, forget about backstage antics, you can never be too sure what he will do on stage.\\\" In addition, some say they're even expecting Snoop Doggy Dogg and Death Row Records' CEO Suge Knight to be part of his entourage, since this will be Tupac's first live TV performance since his incarceration and some expect his record label to make a major show of respect.\\n\\nFor those seeking the calmer side to the show, you'll just have to wait until Feb. 24 when Elle Macpherson hosts and Sting performs.\\n\\nGeorge Will's wife, Mari Maseng who penned Sen. Bob Dole's stodgy State-of-the-Union address response last month may be in hotter water with the majority leader than anyone thought.\\n\\nSources tell us the GOP front-runner was so angry about the entire situation involving Maseng and his widely panned response that he chose not to use a speech that Maseng wrote for this week's annual meeting of the National Governors' Association.\\n\\nFurthermore, in the speech Dole did use written by a staffer in his Senate office he made fun of his lame State-of-the-Union performance.\\n\\nSo, for those keeping score at home Mari isn't suffering writer's cramp.
